Have issues with Citibanks Home Depot card. Tried writing to them, calling numerous times and even went to a Citibank branch & Home Depot. The XXXX XXXX  branch manager called someone for me. I was on phone XXXX minutes. XXXX XXXX XXXX can verify. This was at least my XXXX call. All lasting over an hour nearly two hrs. Transferred between rude, aggressive men to XXXX  XXXX  calls all scratchy & unable to understand. 
Bought mower @ Home Depot. Given me wrong one. Returned for credit & repurchased correct XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. Called Citi asked for billing address as bill hadnt come. Sent {$110.00} ( part of {$220.00} total ). XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX reported to me payment returned undeliverable. Then began receiving bills with $ XXXX late fees. They Agreed to take off one, but then added back next day. I kept sending payments until paid in full. But they kept sending me bills for late fees on late fees I didnt owe. 
When I wrote I got no reply, when I called they passed my call around until I was disconnected after nearly 2 hrs. 
I even sent {$10.00} to keep from getting more late fees. 
I even went on XXXX XXXX to Home Depot . They called for me & on phone in store XXXX hour. Told Id have to wait on hold XXXX mins more for supervisor. Refused on all calls to be passed to manager/supervisor. 
While at XXXX branch on call for XXXX minutes I was told to make {$130.00} pymt or get another {$40.00} fee. I gave him debit info and said I had to go to work. XXXX branch manager will verify. But I see the debit card was not debited and I was charged ANOTHER {$40.00}. 
Definite predatory lending. 

Oh they also wrote me that I was qualified for XXXX XXXX card. Then said no because of Home Depot card",,Monetary Relief,97.60%,,,,,Monetary Relief,"dtdfy,g",,On Track,9.885570957,Yes,97.39%,,
